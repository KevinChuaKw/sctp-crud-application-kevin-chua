data.js 
Will contain the data layer? 
it is all the code that pertain to creating, retreiving, deleting and modifying your database (collection of data)
for example if doing a todolist, then the database will be a collection of all task
this means that the data layer will have functions to add a task, retreive all the tasks, modifying an existing task and deleting a task.
